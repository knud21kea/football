Matches are created by custom algorithm that ensures that in the first 22 rounds
all teams play each other once home and once away.
In the last 10 rounds teams only play the other teams in their group home and away.

So there are generated no matches against the same team.

If the round files are manually edited afterwards, then it is broken.
This could be checked by checking homeAbbr != awayAbbr on import, or by validating
each match on criteria 'has exactly 2 teams' but that is not implemented in this version.
