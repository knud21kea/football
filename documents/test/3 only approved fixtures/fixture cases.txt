Matches are created by custom algorithm that ensures that in the first 22 rounds
all teams play each other once home and once away.
In the last 10 rounds teams only play the other teams in their group home and away.

So all matches in the system are approved.

If the round files are manually edited afterwards, then it is broken.
I don't know any strategy that would check that on import.

There are 2 cases implemented

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a line from a round (a match) is removed, then the program continues without error,
but the stats for that match are not updated. So 2 teams will miss one result.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If an extra line is inserted into a round but doesn't have all of
valid homeAbbr, valid awayAbbr, valid score - the line is skipped and no error occurs.
